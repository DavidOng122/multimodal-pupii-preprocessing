# multimodal-pupii-preprocessing
This project provides a guideline for processing pupil diameter data and integrating it with emotion expression data from multimodal datasets from iMotions10 (version 10.1.38911.4). This project uses python programming lauguage. 'Pupil_Preprocessing_Functions.py' contains functions for cleaning, filtering, interpolating, normalizing, and integrating pupil diameter measurements. 'Example.py' shows how to use those functions.
